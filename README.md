## Core Innovation

### Mathematical Breakthrough
Using **symbolic differential calculus implemented in code** with **unit test verification** to prove fundamental mathematical theorems, combined with **TiddlyWiki's interconnected knowledge structure** for presenting complex mathematical arguments.

### Publication Revolution
Transforming mathematical publication from static linear papers to **interactive, interconnected, explorable mathematical knowledge networks** that enable:

- **Non-linear proof exploration**
- **Automated theorem verification**  
- **Community-based peer review**
- **Cross-referenced mathematical concepts**
- **Population-based validation**
