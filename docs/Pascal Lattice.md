# Pascal–Lattice α/β/γ Simulator

## Motto

**Shape = Number = Flow.**

Lattice A finite Pascal triangle
with binomial weights. Basis: Kravchuk functions on each row (binomial-native orthogonal modes). defines visible vs shadow sheets. Ribbon: A Möbius half-twist across parity implements the shadow flip.

## Definitions

- **Site state** $s_{r,k} \in \{\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \varnothing\}$.
- **$\alpha$**: Cut/cleave (backbone edit; CRISPR/meiosis analogue).
- **$\beta$**: Fold (sheet adjacency; $\beta$-sheet analogue).
- **$\gamma$**: Spin (helical twist; $\alpha$-helix analogue).
- **Energy** $\mathcal{E}_{r,k} = w_{r,k} \langle \chi_R, \chi_{r,k} \rangle$, where $\chi_{r,k}$ is the local “shape character” (epitope/geometry) and $\chi_R$ the receptor/kernel.
- **Temperature** $\tau$: Exploration vs. stability; schedules mimic “8-year reset” cycles.
- **Braid word** $b \in B_m$: Order of external keys/events applied to rows.

## Invariants (must hold unless explicitly broken)

- **Homeostasis H**: Bounded mean curvature of the $\alpha/\beta$ domain wall on the lattice.
- **Fertility/Flow F**: Nonzero percolation of $\beta$ clusters across scales.
- **Repair/Q**: $\alpha$ density limited per window.
- **Energy/E**: $\sum \mathcal{E}_{r,k}$ stays within budget band.

## Operators

- **$\beta$ (Fold)**: Locally aligns neighbors without breaking continuity. Update rule on row $r$: for triads $(k-1,k,k+1)$, if $\mathcal{E}_{r,k} + \mathcal{E}_{r,k\pm1}$ exceeds a Kravchuk-weighted threshold, set $s_{r,k\pm1} \leftarrow \beta$.
- **$\gamma$ (Spin)**: Phase-advance along Kravchuk mode $q$: $s_{r,k} \leftarrow \gamma$ where mode amplitude $A_q(r)$ crosses a phase gate; toggles parity sheet when composed with Möbius.
- **$\alpha$ (Cut)**: Stochastic but budgeted: select sites where tension $T_{r,k}$ (sheet curvature or conflicting modes) is maximal; flip to $\alpha$, then surgery re-glues adjacency per local rule.
- **Möbius flip $\mu$**: Parity involution mapping $(r,k) \mapsto (r,k)$ with sheet tag $p \mapsto p \oplus 1$; $\mu = \alpha \circ \beta$ or $\beta \circ \alpha$ depending on orientation.
- **Braid application**: Apply external key $v_j$ to a chosen row/sector; modify $\chi_{r,k}$ and thresholds; non-commutative via braid relations.

## Dynamics (per tick)

1. **External event**: Read next generator from braid $b$; perturb $\chi$ on a patch.
2. **$\gamma$ wave**: Advance Kravchuk phases rowwise; mark $\gamma$ where gates fire.
3. **$\beta$ relaxation**: Grow $\beta$ clusters along binomial ridges (construct sheets).
4. **$\alpha$ surgery**: Cut at high-tension edges; reattach with potential Möbius flip.
5. **Shadow coupling**: Apply $\mu$ on schedule or when $\alpha \land \gamma$ coincide; exchange visible/shadow occupancy.
6. **Reset schedule**: Modulate $\tau(t)$ with slow cycles; decay stale ledger unless reinforced.

## Cross-scale binding (fractal lift)

- **Row → chain**: Interpret a row’s $\beta$ cluster as a sheet segment; its $\gamma$ activity as helical pitch; its $\alpha$ events as cleavage sites.
- **Block coarsening**: Compress $r$ rows into a “super-site” and reapply the same rules (protein → chromatin → cellular → tissue → immune).
- **Conservation**: Carry $H,F,Q,E$ upward with renormalized thresholds.

## Observables

- $\alpha/\beta/\gamma$ area fractions per scale; domain wall curvature.
- Parity flux (how often $\mu$ flips) = shadow/visible exchange rate.
- Percolation of $\beta$ sheets vs. helicity coherence of $\gamma$ waves.
- Innovation vs. reinforcement index via even/odd exposure windows.
- Safety margin: Minimal slack to violation of $H,F,Q,E$.

## Experiments to run

- **Order matters**: Same keys, permuted braid words; map outcome phase diagram.
- **Reset cycles**: Slow $\tau$ dips (hermit mode) followed by ramps (flow); measure stability and innovation.
- **CRISPR/meiosis unification**: Gate $\alpha$ only when $\beta \land \gamma$ tension > threshold; quantify beneficial vs. catastrophic cuts.
- **Spillover edge**: Populate shadow sheet with near-fits; watch $\beta$-adjacency + $\gamma$-torsion lift them across $\mu$.

## Minimal build prompt

Implement a Pascal-lattice cellular automaton on rows $0..N$ with binomial weights and Kravchuk modes. Each site holds $s \in \{\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \varnothing\}$. Evolve per the Operators/Dynamics above with a temperature schedule and a braid of external keys (each key perturbs local $\chi$). Track invariants $H,F,Q,E$. Provide hooks for (i) Möbius flips, (ii) block-coarsening to higher scales, (iii) parity-based shadow sheet. Output time-series of $\alpha/\beta/\gamma$ maps, parity flux, and phase diagrams over braid orders and reset schedules.

Build using small lambdas.
