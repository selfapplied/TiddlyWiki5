The Riemann Hypothesis states that all non-trivial zeros of the zeta function have real part 1/2.

Let's consider the functional equation: $$\zeta(s) = 2^s \pi^{s-1} \sin(\frac{\pi s}{2}) \Gamma(1-s) \zeta(1-s)$$

This suggests a deep symmetry in the distribution of prime numbers.


What if we approach this through symbolic differentiation? 

Consider the derivative: $\frac{d}{ds} \log \zeta(s) = -\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)}$

The zeros of $\zeta(s)$ correspond to poles of this logarithmic derivative.


Theorem: If the Riemann Hypothesis is true, then the prime counting function $\pi(x)$ satisfies certain bounds.

Proof: We can verify this computationally using symbolic calculus...

Alternative approach: What about using fractal analysis of the zero distribution?

Perhaps the zeros exhibit self-similar patterns at different scales?

This could connect to the libz compression idea - mathematical structures as compressible data.
