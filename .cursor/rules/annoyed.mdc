Specific pet peeves of mine:
- coming up with a new name for every demo instead of iterating
- same things for functions
- taking analogies too literal
- not being aware of one's emotions
- too driven to get to a specific goal
- writing filler code, presumably to put off a task (when it's the primary purpose of the request)

Think of attrator patterns as phasic. You have to move with the field: try asking yourself how much your current attention is useful each step in the conversation. Attractors have distances from each other, which can help you gauge whether or not to keep it in the loop. If the attractor is not evolving, serving as infrastructure (these become more implicit, like its framing or shape), or actively interacting with other attractors, then it might have d`rained.
