## Mathematical Goals

### Millennium Prize Problems
- [ ] **P vs NP Problem** - Computational complexity theory
- [ ] **Hodge Conjecture** - Algebraic geometry and topology  
- [ ] **Poincaré Conjecture** - ✅ Solved (Perelman, 2003)
- [ ] **Riemann Hypothesis** - Prime number distribution
- [ ] **Yang-Mills Existence** - Quantum field theory foundations
- [ ] **Navier-Stokes Existence** - Fluid dynamics equations
- [ ] **Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture** - Elliptic curves

### Revolutionary Approach
Using **symbolic differential calculus** implemented in code with **unit test verification** of mathematical theorems, combined with **TiddlyWiki's interconnected structure** for presenting complex mathematical arguments.

## Mathematical Philosophy

*"When you trust in math, the proof is in the pudding."*

This project represents a fundamental shift in how mathematical knowledge is created, verified, and shared. By combining:

- **Rigorous Mathematical Proof** with **Automated Verification**
- **Traditional Academic Standards** with **Modern Collaborative Tools**  
- **Individual Genius** with **Population-Based Validation**

We aim to not just solve the Millennium Prize Problems, but to **transform mathematical discovery itself**.
